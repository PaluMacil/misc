# &#x1F984; misc

Misc. projects that haven't been moved to a dedicated repo of their own unless noted.

 1. [Pixgame](./pixgame/README.md): Playing with a 2D game library.

    *Language:* **Go**

# Contributions and Issues

My intent is not to have important, maintained projects in this repo. If something grows out of here, it will get its own repo and be linked to from the project readme. However, Feel free to contribute code, raise issues, or ask questions through the issues area. I'll try to respond quickly.

# Licenses

Each misc project is licensed under an [MIT license](./LICENSE) unless the project folder contains a license. In that case, use that license for that project instead. Dependencies will also have licenses of thier own, but in most cases won't be in the repo (depending upon the language).
