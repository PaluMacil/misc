# &#x1F984; misc &#x1F432;

Misc. projects that haven't been moved to a dedicated repo of their own unless noted.

## Projects

 1. [Pixgame](./pixgame/README.md): Playing with a 2D game library named PIXEL.

    *Language:* **Go**
 
 2. [Andlabs Exercise](./andlabsEx/README.md): Playing with Andlabs ui (wrapper for libui) examples.

    *Language:* **Go**

 3. [wxGo Exercise](./wxEg/README.md): Playing with wxGo ui examples. THis wraps the excellent, full featured wxWidgets library.

    *Language:* **Go**

 4. [Github API](./github/README.md): Simple example of unauthenticated Github API v3.

    *Language:* **Go**

 5. [gForm Exercise](./gformEx/README.md): Attempt to compile win32 ui library, gForm. Appears to be a good project but mostly abandoned, and compiling requires cloning an old commit due to an incorrect pull request. It also uses VB6 Common Controls, which needs 32-bit compilation. I won't be fixing this as it doesn't seem to be worth using at this point.

    *Language:* **Go**

 6. [Xamo](./Xamo/README.md): An Android example app from official Xamarin docs.

    *Language:* **C#**

 7. [Electron hello!](./electron-hello/README.md): Simple [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) example.

    *Language:* **JavaScript**

 8. [Git Crawl (gitc)](./gitc/README.md): Bulk commandline TFS to Git migration utility. Real tool but work in progress.

    *Language:* **Go**

 9. [wxPy](./wxPy/README.md): A Demo app. wxWidgets again, this time wrapped in Python (wxPython 4, which is a total refresh called Project Phoenix). Easy and zero trouble. One of my favorite open source Python projects!

    *Language:* **Python**

10. [Go Dep](./go-dep-example/README.md): The example bar chart code from [go-chart](https://github.com/wcharczuk/go-chart) with go dep building. I will re-visit this when Go Dep functionality is documented more clearly.

    *Language:* **Go**

11. [Sandbox](./sandbox): Code so trivial that it is basically the Go Playground. These might be examples of what to do, what not to do, demonstration of a single concept in a standard library package, or something similar. I don't have a README or license available for this folder.

    *Language:* **Go**

11. [Wincred](./wincred): Example code examining your windows credential store.

    *Language:* **Go**

11. [Angular-Electron](./angular-electron/README.md): Example code demonstrating Electron and Angular together with a Photonkit UI.

    *Language:* **TypeScript**

11. [Astilectron](./astilectron-eg): Example code demonstrating Electron in Go (lazy loading or embedding) and go-bindata for embedding.

    *Language:* **Go**

11. [c-webview](./c-webview/README.md): Demonstration of a C webview widget with no functions other than the one method that draws a frame with webkit inside. The demonstration is not yet complete since I need to determine the environmental variables to set on Windows for compilation from MakeFile.

    *Language:* **C**

11. [gohtml](./gohtml/README.md): Example code demonstrating Electron in Go (lazy loading or embedding) and go-bindata for embedding.

    *Language*: **C**

11. [Badger Db Demo](./badger/README.md): An LSM / Value Log Key Value Store.

## Lunch and Learns / Training

# Contributions and Issues

My intent is not to have important, maintained projects in this repo. If something grows out of here, it will get its own repo and be linked to from the project readme. However, Feel free to contribute code, raise issues, or ask questions through the issues area. I'll try to respond quickly.

# Licenses

Each misc project is licensed under an [MIT license](./LICENSE) unless the project folder contains a license. In that case, use that license for that project instead. Dependencies will also have licenses of thier own, but in most cases won't be in the repo (depending upon the language).
