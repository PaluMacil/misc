# &#x1F984; misc &#x1F432;

Misc. projects that haven't been moved to a dedicated repo of their own unless noted.

## Projects

 1. [Pixgame](./pixgame/README.md): Playing with a 2D game library.

    *Language:* **Go**
 
 2. [Andlabs Exercise](./andlabsEx/README.md): Playing with Andlabs ui (wrapper for libui) examples.

    *Language:* **Go**

 3. [wxGo Exercise](./wxEg/README.md): Playing with wxGo ui examples.

    *Language:* **Go**

 4. [Github API](./github/README.md): Simple example of unauthenticated Github API v3.

    *Language:* **Go**

 5. [gForm Exercise](./gformEx/README.md): Attempt to compile win32 ui library, gForm. Appears to be a good project but mostly abandoned, and compiling requires cloning an old commit due to an incorrect pull request. It also uses VB6 Common Controls, which needs 32-bit compilation. I won't be fixing this.

    *Language:* **Go**

 6. [Xamo](./Xamo/README.md): An Android example app from official Xamarin docs.

    *Language:* **C#**

 7. [Electron hello!](./electron-hello/README.md): Simple [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) example.

    *Language:* **JavaScript**

 8. [Git Crawl (gitc)](./gitc/README.md): Bulk commandline TFS to Git migration utility. Real tool but work in progress.

    *Language:* **Go**

 9. [wxPy](./wxPy/README.md): Demo app... wxWidgets again, this time wrapped in Python (wxPython 4, which is a total refresh called Project Phoenix). Easy and zero trouble. One of my favorite open source Python projects!

    *Language:* **Python**

## Lunch and Learns / Training

 1. [Git](./git-LnL/README.md): Intro to Git useful information.

 2. [Go (work in progress)](./Go-LnL/README.md): Some basic information regarding Go. Special focus on http.

# Contributions and Issues

My intent is not to have important, maintained projects in this repo. If something grows out of here, it will get its own repo and be linked to from the project readme. However, Feel free to contribute code, raise issues, or ask questions through the issues area. I'll try to respond quickly.

# Licenses

Each misc project is licensed under an [MIT license](./LICENSE) unless the project folder contains a license. In that case, use that license for that project instead. Dependencies will also have licenses of thier own, but in most cases won't be in the repo (depending upon the language).
