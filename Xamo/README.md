# Xamo

## Summary

Simple Xamarin.Forms example derived from [Getting Started](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/getting-started/) but only including the central library and the Android build project.

## Install

Xamarin tools may be added to Visual Studio 2017 from inside the application, but for 2015 you might need to run the installer. The Android SDK Manager will suggest some recommended build tools, SDKs, etc. Accepting the suggestions is sufficient. You need a 64-bit Java SDK installed. 32-bit Java SDKs will crash without a clear warning and your application will never deploy to the virtualized Android device.
