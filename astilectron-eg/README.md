# Go Astilectron

## Summary

This is example code from [astilectron-go](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron). This project provides a lazy-loaded (or or embedded as an alternative) Electron solution for Go. I was surprised how it all just worked. The download was quick, and the output file was only 6.5MB. I didn't determine where the Electron download wound up, but I will attempt to determine this shortly.

## Install

```
go get ./...
```
