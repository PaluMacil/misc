# gForm Exercise

This repo is currently in a broken state but can be worked around. The original author did a lot of work on documentation, showing MSDN links above functions in the underlying win 32 api wrapper lib. Hopefully this will be fixed, but since I think [this PR](https://github.com/AllenDang/w32/commit/a61dc27a068a1e324c26b5f5d84655cb4824eecb) broke it in April 2016, hope for this project seems dim. Using some pointers in [the issue that discusses the build problems](https://github.com/AllenDang/w32/issues/65), I might be able to compile with a specific commit mentioned in the comments.
