# Go Dep

This is my playground to test the new dep tool that Go will be using to manage dependencies. It uses example code from [Go Chart](https://github.com/wcharczuk/go-chart).

```
dep ensure -v
```

Documentation is still a bit sparse. I thought the above command would place the dependencies in the vendor folder, but that folder remains empty. I will come back to this once documentation improves.
