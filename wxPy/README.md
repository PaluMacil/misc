# wxPy

A simple wxPython example. In Python, wxWidgets is as simple and powerful as it gets with a permissive license for all your needs. This project has different licensing types than my overall repo. Please see the license section below. The official project site is [Project Pheonix](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix] on Github. Please raise any constructive issues or consider contributing to assist with open issues!

## Install

```
pip install wxPython
```

## Run

**simple example**
```
python app.py
```

**webview example**
```
python html.py
```

**License**
The examples, the Python wrapper, and wxWidgets seem to be a mix of a permissive wxWindows license (similar to LGPL) and LGPL, which basically means you can use the code with other components of any other license if you link dynamically. The wxWidgets license goes further to say:
 
"The wxWindows Library Licence is essentially the L-GPL (Library General Public Licence), with an exception stating that derived works in binary form may be distributed on the user's own terms. This is a solution that satisfies those who wish to produce GPL'ed software using wxWidgets, and also those producing proprietary software."

Some examples also seem to be the maximally permissive BSD. The license file itself is in the gitignore, for some reason, so I recommend you use the [wxWidgets license page](https://www.wxwidgets.org/about/licence/) to get a good understanding of the license. Overall, I believe this GUI framework has one of the best licenses out of all major GUI frameworks. I hope you enjoy using it too, and if you have license questions, ask the official wxWidgets team. They're fantastic people.
