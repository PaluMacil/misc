# WxGo Example

I'm currently unable to build with ```go get github.com/dontpanic92/wxGo/wx``` or from a release download. I filed [issues](https://github.com/dontpanic92/wxGo/issues/27) and to ask for help on this. One fix was to change my GCC from sjlj to seh exception handling. Still working to determine a further fix.
