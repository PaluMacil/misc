# Electron
Imagine having a fully customizable Chrome window with any API you could want, such as [installers / auto updaters](https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/auto-updater/) and lots of choices for design, such as [stylesheets that look like Mac applications](http://photonkit.com/components/).

## Install
I'll be assuming that you have [Node installed already. If not, go get it!](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) To install electron globally:
```npm install -g electron```

## Run
To run the app:
```electron .```
