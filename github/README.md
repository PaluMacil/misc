Currently there is no authentication in this example, which means it is rate limited to about 60 API calls per hour. That's plenty for playing around, but if I needed a couple orders of magnitude more API calls, there are a number of other options
 - [Having users authenticate as themselves using OAuth](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/)
 - [Basic Auth, Two Factor, or SAML](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/)
