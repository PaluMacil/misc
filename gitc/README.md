# Git Crawl (gitc)

## Overview
Crawler for bulk git operations

This library is a very simple tool for moving from TFS to Git en masse! It isn't full of features because there are only a few simple tasks I needed to execute, but hopefully it can assist others with the simple tasks it accomplished for me.

## Install
Git is not required. Run the following command:

```
go get github.com\PaluMacil\misc\gitc...
```

## Run
```
